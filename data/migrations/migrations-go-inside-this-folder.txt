 [ ] A **project** is what needs to be done and is stored in a `projects` table with the following columns:

  - [ ] `project_id` - primary key
  - [ ] `project_name` - required
  - [ ] `project_description` - optional
  - [ ] `project_completed` - the database defaults it to `false` (integer 0) if not provided

- [ ] A **resource** is anything needed to complete a project and is stored in a `resources` table with the following columns:

  - [ ] `resource_id` - primary key
  - [ ] `resource_name` - required and unique
  - [ ] `resource_description` - optional

- [ ] A **task** is one of the steps needed to complete a project and is stored in a `tasks` table with the following columns:

  - [ ] `task_id` - primary key
  - [ ] `task_description` - required
  - [ ] `task_notes` - optional
  - [ ] `task_completed` - the database defaults it to `false` (integer 0) if not provided
  - [ ] `project_id` - required and points to an actual `project_id` in the `projects` table

- [ ] A **resource assignment** connects a resource and a project, and is stored in a `project_resources` table. You decide what columns to use.
